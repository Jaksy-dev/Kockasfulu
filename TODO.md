[x] make a naive eval function

[x] make a naive search algorithm

[x] strategy for culling bad trees - alphabeta

[x] negamax instead of minimax

[ ] nicer project structure

[ ] heuristics for evaluation - pawns in centre, castling, knights in middle, rooks on open file, endgame king activation etc.

[ ] opening book - might not be needed

[x] test the time it takes to execute each function

[ ] parallelism

[x] add compile options

[ ] improvements to the search algorithm
    [x] hash table / cache
    [ ] iterative deepening
