# TODO

[x] get input via text commands

[ ] the engine must always be able to process input from stdin, even while thinking (stop)

    not needed for infinite time control

[x] make a naive eval function

[x] make a naive search algorithm

[x] strategy for culling bad trees - alphabeta

[x] negamax instead of minimax

[ ] nicer project structure

[In progress] heuristics for evaluation - pawns in centre, castling, knights in middle, rooks on open file

[ ] Opening/endgame/middlegame awareness

[ ] opening book - might not be needed

[x] test the time it takes to execute each function

[ ] parallelism

[x] add compile options

[ ] improvements to the search algorithm
    
    [ ] iterative deepening
    [ ] move ordering
    [ ] quiesce
    [ ] hash table / cache
